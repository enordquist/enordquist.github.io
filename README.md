Erik Nordquist's homepage, aws Route53 gave me eriknordquist.com, which I linked to Github Pages.

A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.

I customized this while in grad school in Amherst. If you want an easy free website, GitHub Pages username.github.io is a great option!
If you are an academic, I recommend the academicpages.github.io fork of minimal mistakes, or mine if you like my minor customization.

I only request that you remove my logo of the computer with the water molecule on the screen.
