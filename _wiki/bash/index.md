Bash, or the Born-again shell, is one of the most popular and therefore well-documented shell environments, making it an ideal choice for beginners and experts alike. It is the default on many Linux distributions, and was in MacOS until 2019 (Catalina) when the default became z-shell. Note that the Windows shell Command Prompt (cmd.exe) is not Unix-based.
