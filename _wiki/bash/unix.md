Bash, or the born again shell, is a very popular and well-documented command line shell environment for working in the Unix filesystem, and consists of directories (like folders) and files. There are many good overviews to the shell environment I prefer: bash or the born-again shell. The internet is full of great tutorials on unix and bash commands and scripting.

### Key commands to get familiar with:
1. ```mkdir```, ```rmdir```
1. ```ls```
1. ```cd```, ```pwd```
1. ```cp```, ```mv,``` ```rm```
1. ```echo```, ```cat```
1. ```./```, ```../``` (not commands but names of special directories)
1. ```man```

### A brief exercise:
1. Print a brief greeting to the screen, traditionally "Hello, World!"
1. Save that message to a file using redirection, ```> file```
1. Create a new directory named ```dir```
1. Move ```file``` containing your message to the new directory ```dir```
1. Change directories to ```dir```
1. Check that the file is in ./ not ../
1. Double-check the contents of ```file```
1. Remove ```dir``` and ```file```.
