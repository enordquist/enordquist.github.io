While there are always more commands one can learn, I've tried to give a list of some very commonly used ones which are not quite as urgent to learn for beginners, but essential for proficiency. Let me know if more should be added.

### Commands
1. ```wc``` – count lines, words, bytes  
1. ```sort```, ```uniq``` – ordering and deduplication  
1. ```cut```, ```paste``` – slicing and merging columns  
1. ```xargs``` – build command arguments from text  
1. ```watch``` – repeat commands automatically  
1. ```sleep``` – sleep bash for a period of time
1. ```find``` – locate files by name, size, or date  
1. ```bc -l``` - calculator
1. ```du```,```df```,```free``` - filesystem and memory resources
1. ```nvidia-smi``` - print report about any NVIDIA-brand graphics cards enabled

### Concepts
1. Exit codes: ```$?```, ```&&```
1. Quoting: ```" "``` vs ```' '```  
1. Globs: ```*.log```, ```traj_???.dcd```  
1. Environment variables: ```$HOME```, ```$PATH```
