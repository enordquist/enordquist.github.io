### Transient Receptor Potential 1, a.k.a. "the spicy sensor"
The 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to the scientists who discovered that some protein channels are responsible for our sense perception. Below, observe the TRPV1 channel, bound to the "spicy" flavor molecule capsaicin. Along with the other TRPV channels, TRPV1 is responsible for sensing temperature changes. Interestingly, they discovered that when capsaicin molecules bind to TRPV1, it activates in the same way as when our bodies get warmer. **When we eat spicy food, our brains recieve similar chemical signals as when we get hot.** These discoveries helped to explain how our brains, which are fundamentally chemical machines, interact with the external world. 

Below is a 3D image of the TRPV1 channel bound to capsaicin. Try to hunt for the capsaicin molecule, named [4DY](https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/4DY) in this viewer. It is a lipid molecule, meaning it has a long carbon chain. The fact that it is a lipid explains why it does not dissolve well in water, but does dissolve in full-fat milk. You may be familiar with this fact if you've ever had too much hot sauce!
