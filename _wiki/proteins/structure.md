Proteins fold spontaneously into complex 3-dimensional structures in salt water at room and body temperatures, and they are not only critical for life (and mis-folding critical causes of disease), but also stunningly beautiful to behold! You can spend hours on the World Wide Protein Data Bank ([wwPDB](https://rcsb.org)), looking at various structures. Play around with these below! You can rotate and enlarge the structures. Notice the various secondary structures such as $$\alpha$$ helices (purple) and $$\beta$$ sheets (yellow), which are formed by hydrogen-bonding between residue's amide and carbonyl groups.

### Myoglobin (1mbn)
This is one of the proteins responsible for binding to O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> using the Fe-binding molecule protoporphyrin. Myoglobin is significant in the study of protein structure, as it is the first protein to be solved via x-ray crystallography in 1957.

### Chaperone (1dkz)
Proteins natively fold in salt water, but some stresses including high temperature can cause them to unfold. When that happens, the cell need machinery to refold mis/un-folded proteins... the chaperones! They are responsible for binding to the unfolded regions, which helps the rest of the protein to begin to fold again.

### K$$^+$$ channel (6v38)
Potassium (K$$^+$$) channels are remarkably important for their role in the action potential, the symphony-like cascades of sodium and potassium ions into and out of neuron cells, or muscle cells. I have spent a lot of time studying this particular potassium channel. Examine the 4-fold symmetry. See if you can find the $$\alpha$$ helix-rich transmembrane domain that houses the pore and potassium selectivity filter. There is also a large domain that sits beneath the membrane inside of the cell.
