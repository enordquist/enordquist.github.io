```python``` was a paradigm-shifting programming language when it was built in the 1990s, and remains widely in use today by serious programming and beginngers alike. Time spent learning the basics is well spent, as the essential skills will translate to other languages. There is almost no programming task which can't be done well in ```python```.

To work with ```python```, it is best to [install ```mamba```](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html) and then use it to create a new environment, within which you can install various libraries as you need them.
