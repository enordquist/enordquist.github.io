The generalized Born with molecular volume and solvent accessible surface area (GBMV2/SA) implicit solvent model provides an accurate description of molecular volume and has the potential to accurately describe the conformational equilibria of structured and disordered proteins. However, its broader application has been limited by the computational cost and poor scaling in parallel computing. Here, we report an efficient implementation of both the electrostatic and nonpolar components of GBMV2/SA on graphics processing unit (GPU) within the CHARMM/OpenMM module. [...] The successful development of GPU-GBMV2/SA greatly facilitates its application to biomolecular simulations and paves the way for further development of the implicit solvent methodology.
