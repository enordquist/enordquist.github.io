I used molecular dynamics to study huge molecules like proteins.
Molecular dynamics is:
* based on Newton's laws of motion
* importance sampling
* currently taking up most of the world's supercomputer time
  - a similar algorithm to MD is used to study the motions of stars and galaxies: both obey a 1/r law, either Newton's Law or Coulomb's Law
