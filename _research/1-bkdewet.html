In addition to the comprehensive model of BK gating, I have worked on advanced sampling methods for the free energy of dewetting in nanoscale pores including the one in BK. BK channels can be activated by both membrane voltage and intracellular calcium binding. Intriguingly, the structures reveal that the inner pore remains wide-open in both activated and deactivated states. Combining atomistic simulations and experiments, we recently showed that BK channels contain a “hydrophobic gate”, where the inner pore desolvates and is impermeable to ions. 

I have applied a modified protocol of the <a href="/researhc/2-pore">nanopore study</a> to quantify how key inner pore mutations modulate the liquid-vapor equilibrium in the pore. You can read more about it in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2023.02.005">our paper</a>. 

<br>Sometimes, I even able to see a potassium ion permeating through the deep pore, as in the video below...

In the third and final installment of the hydrophobic dewetting saga (currently in prep as of June 2023), we showed exactly how the delicate voltage-dependence of the BK channel gating is exquisitely predicted exactly by the dewetting of the deep pore and the effect on the VSD charges. As the crowning achievement of my passion project as a grad student in Amherst, I personally contributed a culminating piece of this puzzle, by showing for the first time that a (relatively) famous small molecule activator, NS11021, acts on the channel by entering the closed pore and stabilizing the hydrated state. This is the first time a small molecule has been shown to act on a channel via its vapor barrier!
