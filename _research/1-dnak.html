Hsp70s (Heat-shock proteins with molecular weight of 70 kiloDaltons) are a special kind of protein called molecular chaperones and play a central role in the cell's intricate quality control mechanism. They do this in part thanks to a remarkable ability to bind to a wide variety of misfolded proteins without binding to well-folded or intrinsically-disordered proteins. The molecular details of this so-called 'selective promiscuity' is challenging to pin down, since the preference for any given protein sequence over any other is very slight.
I built a model of substrate affinity by training an MD-derived interactions matrix on low-resolution binding affinity data. The resulting model recovers both the binding affinity trends, but also higher resolution information in crystal structures of bound substrates.
