I'm building a model of the BK channel to understand the effects mutations have on the gating voltage and intracellular calcium concentration required for closing.
To fully cover the mutational space, even metadynamics is too expensive, so I will employ cheaper modeling like Rosetta and basis set MD and statistical learning techniques to fit known functional data and make predictions where the data is sparse.
