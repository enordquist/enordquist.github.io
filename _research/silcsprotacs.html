<h2>Computational design of PROTACs</h2>

<p>
<a href="">PROTACs</a>, or Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras, are molecules that combine two "warhead" ligands with a flexible linker, designed to increase the probability that the target protein (warhead 1) is degraded by an E3 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin_ligase">Ubiquitin ligase</a> (warhead 2), allowing the target protein's to be completely abolished. The PROTAC is catalytic and can have high activity despite transiently binding (due to covalent Ub labeling), enabling a much wider array of targets in principle than available to conventional noncovalent inhibitors. This project is ongoing in the MacKerell lab in Baltimore, MD, and is a part of my training in the Cancer Biology T32 in the Univ. Maryland Cancer Center.

The approach will be to leverage the <a href="/research/6-cadd">SILCS</a> (GCMC/MD) fragment affinity FragMaps to determine the Target-Ligase Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) which can allow a PROTAC to bind, then determine which linkers bind best and presumably stablize the complex. We have constructed a large set of >20 protein-ligase complexes with >700 PROTACS characterized with various biological activity data to guide and benchmark our protocol.

<h2>Computational design of Covalent ligands for cancers like AML</h2>
Acute myeloid leukemia remains a challenging disease, due to drug resistant mutations that emerge rapidly in the clinic. In collaboration with Steve Fletcher and Curt Civin, we are developing a wide array of covalent ligands for targets involved in AML, such as the kinase FLT3 and the anti-apoptotic protein BFL-1. To learn more about the SILCS-Covalent method, you can read the paper of Yu, et al <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00232">here</a>.
