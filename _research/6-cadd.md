The <a href="https://mackerell.umaryland.edu/research.shtml">MacKerell lab</a> has developed a computer-aided drug discovery method called Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS), which uses convential molecular dynamics simulations of a target protein solvated by a saturated solution of water and many small molecule fargments. The simulation inherently gives the free energy profile of each ligand across the complete surface of the protein as a dynamic, rather than static object. A key breakthrough to this technology was the use of an enhanced type of molecular simulation technique, oscillating-chemical potential Grand Canonical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#Applications">Monte Carlo simulations</a>, to enhance the sampling of small molecule fragments within hard-to-reach binding pockets. This approach is somewhat computationally-analogous to the experimental method of Fragment-based screening using crystallography or NMR, but is much faster than both and improves on the lack of protein flexibility in crystallography and the spatial resolution of NMR.

<br><br><b>Disclaimer:</b> The SILCS GCMC/MD simulation method and related tools is the basis of a private company, <a href="https://silcsbio.com/">SilcsBio, LLC</a>, of which my advisor Alexander D. MacKerell, Jr. is co-founder and CSO. I am working for Alex as part of the University of Maryland Balitmore and the NIH, not SilcsBio; however, we are all (UMB, NIH, SilcsBio) invested in essentially the same goals, and the University of Maryland, Balitmore actively promotes the exchange of ideas between industry and academia.<br> <br>
