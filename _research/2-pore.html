title: "Protein-like nanopore dewetting"
excerpt: "Why do some protein ion channels like the BK channel, which are quite large ~1.2 nm diameter, have vapor rather than physical barriers?<br/><img src='/images/nanopore_popart.jpg' width='300' height='300'><br/>"

<p>In nano-scale confined environments, water exists in a delicate equilibrium between condensed and vapor phase. We are using simple model nanopores to study the effects of pore morphology and co-solvent concentration on the free energy cost of dewetting, in order to apply what I learn to real proteins like the BK channel. This work was done with Sam Schultz in Jianhan's lab. We made this pop-art of some snapshots of a nanopore dewetting for an image competition:</p>
