                The <a href="https://mackerell.umaryland.edu/research.shtml">MacKerell lab</a> has developed a computer-aided drug discovery method called Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS), which uses convential molecular dynamics simulations of a target protein solvated by a saturated solution of water and many small molecule fargments. The simulation inherently gives the free energy profile of each ligand across the complete surface of the protein as a dynamic, rather than static object. A key breakthrough to this technology was the use of an enhanced type of molecular simulation technique, oscillating-chemical potential Grand Canonical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#Applications">Monte Carlo simulations</a>, to enhance the sampling of small molecule fragments within hard-to-reach binding pockets. This approach is somewhat computationally-analogous to the experimental method of Fragment-based screening using crystallography or NMR, but is much faster than both and improves on the lack of protein flexibility in crystallography and the spatial resolution of NMR.

<br><br><b>Disclaimer:</b>This technology is the basis of a private company, <a href="https://silcsbio.com/">SilcsBio</a>, which was co-invented by my postdoctoral advisor Alex MacKerell, Ph.D. (currently CSO) and his former postdoc Olgun Guvench, Ph.D. (currently Managing Partner). I am working for Alex as part of the University of Maryland Balitmore and the NIH, not SilcsBio; however, we are all invested in essentially the same goals: target proteins as moving, dynamic objects using molecular simulations as a starting point to ultimately alleviate or cure diseases. I am working on using these GCMC-MD simulations on large, transmembrane proteins like the BK channel, which have enormous health implications in many diseases including heart disease, epilepsy and other neurological disorders, and cancer.<br> <br>

You can read more about the method of GCMC-MD at the <a href="https://mackerell.umaryland.edu/research.shtml">MacKerell lab's Research page></a>, or by reading <a href="http://doi.org/10.1021/ct500201y">this paper</a>. There is a fantastic-looking and easy-to-use <a href="https://landing.silcsbio.com/newlandingpage?_gl=1*dkn3l3*_ga*MTY5OTgyOTExOS4xNjg5Mzk0Mzk3*_ga_7J13TR2SMG*MTY4OTM5NDM5Ni4xLjEuMTY4OTM5NTc3MC4wLjAuMA">Interactive demo</a> on the SilcsBio (R) website for a hands-on and visual guide of the method and how it helps scientists like me (and you too) identify binding sites.
