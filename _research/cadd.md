The <a href="https://mackerell.umaryland.edu/research.shtml">MacKerell lab</a> has developed a computer-aided drug discovery method called Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS), which uses convential molecular dynamics simulations of a target protein solvated by a saturated solution of water and small molecule fragments. The result is a comprehensive 3D free energy affinity map of each fragment (FragMap) across the complete surface of the protein as a dynamic, rather than static object. The solutes and FragMaps are depicted below. A key breakthrough to this technology was the use of an enhanced type of molecular simulation technique, oscillating-chemical potential Grand Canonical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#Applications">Monte Carlo simulations</a>, to enhance the sampling of small molecule fragments within hard-to-reach binding pockets. This approach is somewhat computationally-analogous to the experimental method of Fragment-based screening using crystallography or NMR, but is much faster than both and improves on the lack of protein flexibility in crystallography and the spatial resolution of NMR.
