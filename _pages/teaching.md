I was instructor of record for a self-designed first year seminar course for the Fall semester of 2022, entitled "Order and Chaos". A key motivating topic of the course was the idea that atomic motion can seem chaotic, random, bizzare, and disconnected from the world we live in. Through some final, multi-week long group projects, the students explored ways that random atomic motion can give rise to emergent, stable properties. I also gave the students lots of time and practice writing, reading, speaking and listening to scientific storytelling.

Key topics for the course:
1. "Think like a scientist"
  * Scientific storytelling skills
  * Formulate scientific questions
  * Conduct mini research projects
  * Assessments included mini-storytelling writings/presentations, and a multi-week final project and presentation
2. "Hidden cirriculum" of college
  * Who are professors?
  * Time-management and test-taking skills
  * What resources are available to help students?
