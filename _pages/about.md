Where am I now: Grad School at UMass Amherst
-----
I'm currently learning a lot in Jianhan Chen's [computational biophysics lab](https://people.chem.umass.edu/jchenlab/main.html). We primarily use a computational chemistry technique called Molecular Dynamics, with which we simulate the motions of biological molecules like proteins and use the data we get from simulations to answer questions about how the dynamic wiggles of proteins help them to perform their various functions.

Where I'd like to get: Professor
---
I enjoy thinking about and doing science, as well as talking to others about it and explaining it to people to people experiencing it for the first time. I plan to continue to prepare myself for a career as a professor at a PUI until I can be competitive to land my 'dream position'. I envision using a small, student- and/or course-focused research program to enhance the learning of core concepts as well as the power and flexibility of the scientific method.

Where I've been: The College of Idaho, a Liberal Arts Background
---
I majored in Physics and Chemistry at [the College of Idaho](https://collegeofidaho.edu) and graduated in 2018. I also studied Computer Science, History and Philosophy. I really enjoyed the liberal arts education model and believe I benefited greatly from it. I also ran [XC and track](https://yoteathletics.com/sports/mens-cross-country/roster/2017) and learned to swim. Caldwell is ~120 mi from my hometown, Jerome ID, and it's where I met my wife Zoe and near where we were married in 2020.
