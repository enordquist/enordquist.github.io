Grad School at UMass Amherst
-----
I'm currently in Jianhan Chen's [computational biophysics lab](https://people.chem.umass.edu/jchenlab/main.html). We primarily use a computational chemistry technique called Molecular Dynamics, with which we simulate the motions of biological molecules like proteins and use the data we get from simulations to answer questions about how the dynamic wiggles of proteins help them to perform their various functions.

The College of Idaho, a Liberal Arts Background
---
I majored in Physics and Chemistry at [the College of Idaho](https://collegeofidaho.edu) and graduated in 2018. I also studied Computer Science, History and Philosophy. I really enjoyed the liberal arts education model and believe I benefited greatly from it. I also ran [XC and track](https://yoteathletics.com/sports/mens-cross-country/roster/2017) and learned to swim
