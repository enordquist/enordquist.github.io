I'm currently getting a PhD in Jianhan Chen's [computational biophysics lab](https://people.chem.umass.edu/jchenlab/main.html). We primarily use a computational technique called Molecular Dynamics, with which we simulate the motions of biological molecules like proteins and use the resulting simulations to answer questions about how protein dynamics (aka wiggles) help them to perform their various functions. My dissertation revovles around building predictive models of protein function by integrating simulations, experiments using techniques of statistical inference.


Long-term goal: Professor at PUI
---
I am working towards my 'dream position': professor at a primarily undergraduate-serving institution teaching physical chemistry and using a small research program to enhance the learning experience of my students.
I'm learning while [mentoring undergraduates](teaching/mentoring), and serving as a [JEI reviewer](https://www.emerginginvestigators.org/), that computational chemistry lends itself nicely to clean, compartmentalized projects with minimal costs, materials and time constraints.
