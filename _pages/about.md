Where am I now: Grad School at UMass Amherst
-----
I'm currently getting a PhD in Jianhan Chen's [computational biophysics lab](https://people.chem.umass.edu/jchenlab/main.html). We primarily use a computational technique called Molecular Dynamics, with which we simulate the motions of biological molecules like proteins and use the resulting simulations to answer questions about how protein dynamics (aka wiggles) help them to perform their various functions. My dissertations revovles around building predictive models of protein function by integrating simulations, experiments and statistical learning.


Where I'd like to get: Professor
---
I enjoy thinking about and doing science, as well as talking to others about it and explaining it to people to people experiencing it for the first time. 
I plan to continue to prepare myself for a 'dream position' a professor at a primarily undergraduate-serving institution.
I'm excited to use small research projects to enhance the learning experience.
I'm learning while [mentoring undergraduates](teaching/mentoring) and serving as a [JEI reviewer](https://www.emerginginvestigators.org/) that computational biophysics and even quantum chemistry lends itself nicely to clean, compartmentalized projects.

Where I've been: The College of Idaho, a liberal arts background
---
I majored in Physics and Chemistry at [the College of Idaho](https://collegeofidaho.edu) and graduated in 2018. To maintain the required breadth at the college, I also studied History, Philosophy, and Computer Science. I enjoyed the liberal arts education model and believe I benefited greatly from it. I also ran [XC and track](https://yoteathletics.com/sports/mens-cross-country/roster/2017) and learned to swim, activities I still enjoy today. Caldwell is ~120 mi from my hometown, Jerome ID, and it's where I met my wife Zoe and near where we were married in 2020.
