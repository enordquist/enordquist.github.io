title: "BK Channel Gating"
excerpt: "Hydrophobic dewetting forms a vapor barrier and closes BK Channel; what role do specific mutations play in (de-)stabilizing this delicate liquid-vapor interplay?<br/>"

I'm building a model of the BK channel to understand the effects mutations have on the gating voltage and intracellular calcium concentration required for closing.
I can use metadynamics to drive otherwise slow dewetting transitions in order to study the effects a mutation or even a drug will have on pore dewetting and channel opening.
Sometimes, we even see an ion permeation, as in the video...
To fully cover the mutational space, even metadynamics is too expensive, so I will employ basis set MD and statistical learning techniques to fit known functional data and make predictions where the data is sparse.
