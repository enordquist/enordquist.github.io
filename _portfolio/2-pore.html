<p>In nano-scale confined environments, water exists in a delicate equilibrium between condensed and vapor phase. We are using simple model nanopores to study the effects of pore morphology and co-solvent concentration on the free energy cost of dewetting, in order to apply what I learn to real proteins like the BK channel. This work is being done with Sam Schultz, currently an undergrad at UMass.
