I have taken several courses associated with CIRTL on the online learning platform edX, including:
* [Introduction to Evidence-based Undergraduate STEM Teaching](/posts/2021/10/IEBT)
* [The Inclusive STEM Teaching Project](/posts/2021/07/ISTP)

You can read more about these courses in their 'news' pages on my website (links above) or you can go directly to
[the Inclusive STEM Teaching Project](https://inclusivestemteaching.org), [the CIRTL network](https://cirtl.net), or [the edX platform](https://edx.org).
