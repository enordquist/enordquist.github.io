"Old age hath yet his honor and his toil.<br>
Death closes all; but something ere the end,<br>
Some work of noble note, may yet be done,<br>
Not unbecoming men that strove with gods.<br>
The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;<br>
The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep<br>
Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,<br>
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.<br>
Push off, and sitting well in order smite<br>
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds<br>
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths<br>
Of all the western stars, until I die.<br>
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;<br>
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,<br>
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.<br>
Though much is taken, much abides; and though<br>
We are not now that strength which in old days<br>
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,<br>
One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br>
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br>
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."<br>
