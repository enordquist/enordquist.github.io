I learned as a kid, and started learning again in graduate school.
My wife Zoe an accomplished musician who plays violin, ukelele, spanish guitar,
and writes and records her own music on YouTube...
I on the other hand, make my own arrangements of children's music to practice my theory and composition skills.
