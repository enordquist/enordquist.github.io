My paper on hydrophobic dewetting, published with Jianhan and Zhiguang, was awarded a palce among twenty others in the Best of Biophysical Journal 2023 edition! This is a big honor, and feels immensely gratifying! This was in a way my first attempt to guide the direction of a research project more directly, although Jianhan of course provided many critical suggestions and corrections. The honor came as a surprise since none of us knew about the honor until seeing the issue in print after the BPS Annual Meeting in Philadelphia.
