I have accepted a position at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, in [Alex MacKerell's lab](http://mackerell.umaryland.edu/) in the School of Pharmacy. In addition, I have been awarded funding through the [Cancer Biology T-32 training grant](https://lifesciences.umaryland.edu/molecularmedicine/Cancer-Biology-T-32-Training-Grant/). I will utilize [simulation techniques devleoped by Alex's group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x27lnGC-U5E&ab_channel=UMBCVIP) to identify drug-like small molecules for targeting ion channels (BK in particular) in cancer cells.

I'm happy to be in the closing chapter of my time at Amherst, but it will be a big transition to the city of Baltimore and bittersweet to leave my home for the last 5 years. I'm excited to learn many new things in my next destination from Alex and the rest of his lab!
Plus, I'll be within an hour of D.C. and many national monuments and historic Civil War battlefields.
