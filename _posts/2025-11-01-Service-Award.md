I was awarded the Postdoctoral Fellow Excellence in Service Award. It was a great honor to be recognized by the University for all the work I do with outreach to local students. I love interacting with student of all ages, including young kids at an annual halloween event, middle-school kids with a mix of youthful energy and a sense of responsibility for important questions, and high-schoolers who are starting to imagine their role in society and solving hard problems.
