Not pictured, the participants of the science camp, because of legal constraints, but you can see more photos <a href='https://people.chem.umass.edu/jchenlab/images/eureka/eurika22b.jpg'>here</a> and on Jianhan's website <a href='https://people.chem.umass.edu/jchenlab/news.html'>here</a>.

Some key take-aways:
------
* 8th graders are not all the same, yet
* they can handle a lot, and definitely appreciate a challenge!
