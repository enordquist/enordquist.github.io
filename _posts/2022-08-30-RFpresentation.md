For my recent presentation at the UMass Chemistry ResearchFest, I was awarded the second-place award, a great honor and a generous monetary prize. I was among 4 student speakers selected for the highly-competitive presentations each year. One senior student per lab can be nominated. I was following in the tradition of the great Xiaorong Liu, who spoke at my first ResearchFest in 2018.

Some key take-aways:
------
* I have made a lot of progress since my first ResearchFest in 2018, when Dr. Liu wow-ed me with her talk about her work, including HyRes.
* I still get very stressed before a 'competition' or big talk
* With careful preparation, I can make a very nice talk
