This online course (through the edX platform and CIRTL) introduced me to the kinds of challenges facing an 'expert' in a field who is trying to reach a collection of students with various skills, previous knowledge, and emotions. It also convinced me I will not learn to teach without many attempts and iterative improvements.

Some key take-aways:
------
* Elements of good course design include:
  * Has lots of elements of active learning!
  * Alignment between course objectives, activities and assessments
  * Inclusively accomodate the important ways people are different
  * Foster Growth-mindset:
    * opportunities to improve, fix things
    * focus on the process of learning
    * praise students for their effort, commitment, improvement
* The final project was a fairly detailed lesson plan, which I wrote about polyprotic acid titrations.
  * Writing detailed lesson plans is difficult
  * I would need to teach this lesson many times to improve it
  * It may not be necessary to plan every lesson to this detail; some ideas can carry-over across the course
