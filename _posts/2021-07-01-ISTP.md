This online course (through the edX platform) used embodied case study videos and self-reflection prompts to train grad students, postdocs and current faculty to approach education through personal and inclusive strategies backed by the latest educational reserach.

Key take-aways:
------
* Have **empathy**
* Inclusive teaching, like most things, needs to be **continually refined**, never mastered.
* Allowing time and energy to **humanize everyone** in the classroom who wants to share
* Explicitly note that many pioneers of physics and chemistry were wealthy European men, while also:
  * recognizing where women and others played crucial roles in the past, and
  * insisting that anyone can learn science, and I'm eager to guide them!
