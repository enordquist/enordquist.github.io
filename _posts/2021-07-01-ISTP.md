This online course (through the edX platform) used embodied case study videos and self-reflection prompts to train grad students, postdocs and current faculty to approach education through personal and inclusive strategies backed by the latest educational reserach.

Key take-aways:
------
* Have empathy
* Inclusive teaching, like most things, needs to be continually refined over time, never fully 'mastered'.
* Making time and energy to humanize myself is important, as is allowing my students to also humanize themselves.
* It is important to recognize the roles that European men played in STEM traditionally 
  * (i.e. explicitly note that many pioneers of physics and chemistry were men), while also recognizing where women played crucial roles.
  * Then, recognize where women and others played crucial roles in the past
  * and recognize that anyone who's motivated to learn science and make a difference for the future may do so, and I'm eager to help!
