My first class, a first-year seminar called "Order and Chaos, Reconciling atomic randomness and the human world" was a big success.
Some of the final projects students designed, carried out and presented:
* Gas permeation through a eggshell-like membrane (pictured below)
* Irreversibility of an explosion simulation
* Thermal equilibration and planet formation
* Equilibration of plucked strings


Some key take-aways:
------
* I can do this, and more importantly, I enjoy doing this even when it is difficult.
* I had two very different groups of students: one highly engaged and one disengaged
  * In neither case was it helpful to worry too much about something "going great" or "going poorly"
  * It was helpful to simply recognize if something went poorly, and think "can I easily address that next time?"
* Definitely want to ask to be called "Professor" and assert a reasonable amount of authority
