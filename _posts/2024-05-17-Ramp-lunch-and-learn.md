I volunteered at the UMB RAMP program's May Lunch & Learn activity, where a UMB researcher meets with a small group of high school students to discuss their researhc, career development and trajectory, and then give a demonstration with a hands-on activity. The students played a short game of Monte Carlo pi estimation in person, then we wrote some python code to do the same thing. While not directly related to molecular simulation, it relates a few key ideas, like how seemingly "random" events can converge on a stable value, or how useful computers can be to iterate over a simple, repeatable arithmetic task.
