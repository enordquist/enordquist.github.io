The Chemistry Biology Interface (CBI) is a competitive NIH-funded fellowship designed "to train students with diverse scientific backgrounds for productive research at the interface between chemistry and biology" at UMass."

A few cool things I did:
------
* Chalk talks: short presentations (5-20 min) to a very broad audience of students and faculty.
* Genomics lab module, intro both experimental and bioinformatics methods
* Ethics in science module
* Drug Design course - many important and interesting speakers in the field, including Chris Lipinski, Pat Walters, and Woody Sherman.
