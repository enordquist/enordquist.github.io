The Chemistry Biology Interface (CBI) is a competitive NIH-funded fellowship designed "to train students with diverse scientific backgrounds for productive research at the interface between chemistry and biology" at UMass."

A few cool things I did:
------
* Science communication to a broad audience:
  * Chalk talks: short presentations (10-20 min) to a very broad audience of students and faculty.
  * Student Seminar: short presentations (~25 min) to other CBI fellows in disciplines such as Chemical Engineering, Biochemistry, Molecular biology, Cellular biology, Biophysics, Chemistry, Polymer science
* Laboratory training modules:
  * Computational modeling and simulation
  * Genomics / bioinformatics
  * 3D printing
  * NMR
* Ethics in science module
* Drug Design course - many important and interesting speakers in the field, including Chris Lipinski, Pat Walters, and Woody Sherman.
* Lots of professional development, mostly focused on [teaching](/posts/2021/10/training/)
