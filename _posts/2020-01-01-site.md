My colleague Xiping Gong and I learned that one can host a free website at username.github.io using a special repo with that name. He then found the awesome template [academicpages.github.io](https://academicpages.github.io), which I immediately forked and started using. Since then, many of my colleagues have followed suit:

[Yiling Nan](https://yilingnan.xyz)
<br>
[Hualu Zhou](https://zhouhualu.com)
<br>
[Jian Huang](https://huang-jian.com)
<br>
[Xiping Gong](https://xipinggong.com)
<br>
[Yumeng Zhang](https://yumzhang17.github.io)
<br>
[Prabin Baral](https://https://prbnbaral.github.io/)

I've learned some basics:
-------------------
* html
* jekyll
* github
