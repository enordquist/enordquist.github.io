I gave a very brief invited student talk at virtual structural biology conference, where I emphasized the importance of the structural insights we got from experiments to the Paladin model, and how the model was able to recapitulate details of X-tal structures in a novel and impressive way.

This came on the heels of many breakthroughs in this project in the summer of 2020, and some very enjoyable talks besides this one: Lila Gierasch's group meeting, and the Chemistry-Biology Interface Chalk Talk. In my first two years in grad school, I had improved my ability to give presentations.
